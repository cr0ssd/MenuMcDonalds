# Menu McDonalds    

This project was made as a Data Science 101 class. It's meant to help people who are on a diet but still want to have cheat meals. The data used on this project comes from a .csv file that was scraped off of McDonalds online menu. In the future it's meant to integrate a person's database with data imported from Apple Watch and Whoop bands.
